# Task 3: Password Complexity Checker

This Python program evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, offering users feedback on how secure their passwords are. The tool provides tips for creating strong passwords and ensures that users understand the importance of various password components.

## Features

- **Password Strength Assessment**: The tool checks for the following criteria to evaluate password strength:
  - Minimum length of the password
  - Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Inclusion of numbers
  - Use of special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)

- **Feedback on Password Strength**: Users receive a message indicating whether their password is:
  - Very Strong
  - Strong
  - Moderate
  - Weak

- **Password Masking**: For privacy, the tool masks the password input before displaying it, protecting user confidentiality.

- **Security Tips**: The program provides tips for creating secure passwords and maintaining good password hygiene, ensuring users are informed about best practices.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the Password Complexity Checking Tool.

## bash

   python password_complexity_checker.py

Read Tips: Review the provided tips for creating a secure password, which will be displayed upon starting the program.
